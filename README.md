# BlackJack
Blackjack Simulation
This is a C++ program that simulates a game of Blackjack. The program was originally written in college, and this version has been updated and optimized.

Requirements:
C++ compiler
Standard C libraries

Usage:
Compile the program using your C++ compiler.
Run the executable file.
The program will simulate 1000 games of Blackjack, and the results will be displayed in the console.

How it Works
The program simulates a game of Blackjack by creating a deck of cards, shuffling the deck, dealing two cards to the player and two cards to the dealer, and then allowing the player to hit or stand. The dealer must hit until they have a total of 17 or higher. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins. If the player's hand is higher than the dealer's hand, the player wins. If the dealer's hand is higher than the player's hand, the dealer wins. If both the player and dealer have the same hand value, the game is a draw.

The program simulates 1000 games of Blackjack in order to evaluate various player strategies against 'House Rules', and then displays the results of those games. The results include the number of games won by the player, the number of games won by the dealer, the number of games that ended in a draw, and the percentage of games won by the player.

Credits
This program was originally written by Joel to fulfill an assignment for Computer Science and Calculus Modeling but recently updated.
